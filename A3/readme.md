Operating system: Windows 11 Home 24H2, build 26100.3476  
Compiler: Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.43.34809 for x86

Running the program:
Navigate to the root folder then in the terminal `mkdir build` `cd build` `cmake ..` `cmake --build .` `./Debug/453-skeleton.exe`.  
Note: If running this program on the CPSC lab machines, building the program may create the PirateShipGame.exe on the root build folder instead of inside the Debug folder.  
In that case, type `./453-skeleton.exe` instead of `./Debug/453-skeleton.exe`
