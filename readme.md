### OpenGL Solar system overview
This project is built on basic boilerplate code from school. The actual implementation of the solar system and its related features are coded from scratch.
The program allows you to visualize the solar system with basic lighting techniques and user interfaces using ImGui and mouse controls.

# Running the program
Navigate to the root folder then in the terminal `mkdir build` `cd build` `cmake ..` `cmake --build .` `./Debug/solarsystem.exe`.  

# Controls  
Panning: Hold right click and drag the mouse/trackpad   
Zooming: Scroll up/down with scroll wheel/trackpad
Other controls (Changing planet target, time scale, etc.): From the ImGui panel
